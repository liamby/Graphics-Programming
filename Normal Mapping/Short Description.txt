The scene demonstrated for this assignment contains a skybox with a cube that has the texture and Normal Map of a brick wall applied to it. 
The code builds off the work done in the last assignment as well as relying heavily on the learnOpenGL website both for assets for the project such as skyboxes, 
models and textures as well as code that has been used in the normal mapping shader program as well as in the main.cpp file. 
Most of the code in the main.cpp file has been altered from Lab 04 of the Computer Graphics module, 
however, regions such as the TEXTURE_FUNCTIONS region and loadCubemap functions have been taken from LearnOpenGL website.
