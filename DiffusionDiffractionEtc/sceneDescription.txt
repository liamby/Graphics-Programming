The scene contains three models, surrounded by a skybox from the website learnOpenGL which is used to demonstrate the shader programmes. 
The first model demostrates reflectance and shows the back of the skybox in the curved surface of the teapot. The second demonstrates the fresnell shader.
which balances reflection and refraction depending on the viewing angle of the camera, which makes the image on the edge of the teapot appear
to switch direction as the viewer reaches a flatter angle and refraction turns to reflection. A cube was used to demonstrate the fresnel shader as it was 
challenging to observe on the curved surface of a teapot. The final effect demonstrates chromatic dispersion which occurs when light refracting through 
an object gets split up into its different wavelengths. The code for this lab builds off of the codebase which was provided to us by Professor McDonnell last 
year as part of the module Computer Graphics and the previous Lab 1 assignment as well as code from Joey de Vries' learnOpenGL.  The video demonstration of the
